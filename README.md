# Monthly System Monitoring Preprocessing Data Automate Script

## Overview

This script is designed to automate the preprocessing of system monitoring data on a monthly basis. It helps in efficiently handling and preparing the collected system data for further analysis or reporting purposes.

## Features

- Automated Data Preprocessing: The script automates the process of preprocessing system monitoring data, saving time and effort.
- Customizable Parameters: Users can adjust parameters according to their specific data requirements.
- Error Handling: Includes robust error handling mechanisms to deal with unexpected issues during preprocessing.
- Logging: The script logs important events and errors for easy troubleshooting and monitoring.

## Usage

1. **Data Collection**: Ensure that the system monitoring data is collected and stored in the designated location.
2. **Configuration**: Modify the script configuration file (if necessary) to specify input/output paths, data formats, and preprocessing steps.
3. **Run Script**: Execute the script either manually or schedule it to run automatically on a monthly basis using task schedulers or cron jobs.

## Requirements

- `sar`, `egrep`, `sed`, `awk`, `zip`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Install required dependencies: Depend on your machine _Package Manger_

## Configuration

- Specify the input and output directories, file formats, preprocessing steps, etc.

## Execution

Run the script using the following command:

```sh
./monthly.sh
```

## Example

Suppose you have system monitoring data stored in CSV format in a directory named `input_data`, and you want to preprocess it by removing outliers and aggregating monthly statistics. You would configure the script accordingly and execute it. Upon completion, the preprocessed data will be saved in the `output_data` directory for further analysis.
